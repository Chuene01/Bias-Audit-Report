Bias & Fairness Audit Report

Overview
This repository contains a Bias and Fairness Audit Report implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook evaluates potential bias in machine learning predictions by analyzing group-wise performance, fairness metrics, and visual diagnostics, and it proposes mitigation strategies to address identified issues.

The audit is designed to be defensive and adaptable, meaning it will automatically detect available variables and only compute metrics when the required data is present.

Purpose
The primary goals of this audit are to:
- Identify potential bias across sensitive groups
- Evaluate fairness-related performance gaps
- Provide visual and statistical evidence of disparities
- Suggest practical mitigation strategies
- Support responsible and ethical machine learning practices
